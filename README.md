# 🌌 Star Odyssey: Quantum Command

## 📜 Era Estelar e a Herança dos Quarxiums

A thousand years after the founding of the **United Federation of Planets**, the galaxy lives under an **illusory peace** — a fragile truce sustained by a single goal: **to erase the remnants of the Quantum War**.

That war was fought against a civilization now believed to be extinct: the **Quarxiums**.

The Quarxiums were a species **hybrid of organic consciousness and pure energy**, peaceful beings with a **deep understanding of the laws of the universe**.  
They were the creators of the legendary **Quarks Engine**, a technology capable of **bending the fabric of reality** and **generating infinite energy from the vacuum**.

When the Federation attempted to seize control of this technology, it triggered the most devastating conflict in galactic history.  
The Federal Fleet was nearly **annihilated**, and countless worlds were torn apart by dimensional ruptures.  
From that war emerged the **permanent energy anomalies** that still scar stellar maps today.

Before the Federation’s destruction could be completed, the Quarxiums **vanished**.  
Some claim it was an act of fear. Others, an act of mercy.  
What remains is that **they are gone**, leaving behind only **fragments of their technology** and **hybrid descendants** — humans and aliens who inherited quantum traits within their DNA.  
They are known as the **Echoes**.

## 💎 Energy Crystals — The Quarxium Legacy

After the end of the war, engineers from the surviving worlds discovered that the **Quarks Portals themselves generate the Quarxium Crystals**.

These crystals are capable of **storing condensed dimensional energy** — the raw power of space-time converted into matter.  
The simple act of **traveling through the universe** creates energy for others.

The Quarxiums left behind an encrypted message, still not fully understood:

> “The knowledge of the universe creates life… but also death.”

These crystals became the **most valuable resource in the cosmos**.  
A single fragment can power a ship, a station — even an entire planet.  
Because of this, **all governments** began hunting those who still possessed Quarxium engines or the secrets behind their operation.

The descendants — the **Echoes** — took refuge aboard vast **sanctuary ships** known as **Andara**: unarmed vessels that preserve the ancestral knowledge of the Quarxiums.  
They are protected by the **Unbound** (*Sem-Constelação*), space nomads who reject flags and live beyond the Federation’s reach.

## 🌀 Quarks Portals

**Quarks Portals** are **dimensional ruptures** activated by **Quarxium engine technology**.  
They serve as passages connecting **distant regions of the galaxy** — and, in rare cases, **parallel realities**.

Each time a Quarks Engine is activated, space folds at a **subatomic scale**, allowing one to cross the galaxy as if it were a single step.  
These jumps leave behind energetic traces — **residual crystals** — which can be **collected, refined, and reused**, forming the backbone of the interstellar economy beyond the Federation’s control.

The use of this technology is **strictly forbidden**, but in the vacuum of space, **laws are only ideas**.  
For independent ships, **using a quantum portal is not a crime — it is survival**.

## 👨‍🚀 Your Role

You are the **Commander** of the ship **Sword of Andara**, an unregistered vessel equipped with an **active Quarxium Engine** and forbidden technology inherited from the Quarxiums.

Hunted by the Federation, you live on the edge between known and unknown space, amid **the wreckage of war and the myths of the past**.

## 👩‍🔧 Your Core Crew

### Arlen Voss — Chief Engineer  
A former Federal Fleet officer and one of the few survivors of the Quantum War.  
He carries the guilt of having helped create the first engines used as weapons.  
Now, he devotes his life to **correcting that mistake**, seeking to prove that quantum energy can be a force of redemption.

### Lyra Quarx — Number One  
Daughter of a human and a Quarxium.  
Her partially energetic biology allows her to **sense quantum distortions** and **anticipate portal instabilities**.  
The Federation considers her an aberration; to the **Unbound**, she is a **living bridge between matter and energy**, the link between two worlds.

## 🎯 Your Mission

> **Locate the Heart of Andara sanctuary ships** and **supply them with Quarxium Crystals**, ensuring their continued existence — and with them, the last thread of hope in the universe.

Along the way, you will face:

- Patrols of the **United Federation**,  
- Corsairs and mercenaries from the **Ceres Belt**,  
- And the dark echoes of the **Quantum War**, which seem to resurface through dimensional rifts.

Your journey is one of **survival, discovery, and sacrifice**, revealing that the boundary between **life and energy** is far thinner than any mind can comprehend.

> **Do not expect a welcome from anyone.**

## 🌠 Central Theme

> “Freedom is energy.  
> And energy… always comes at a price.”

Every jump, every portal, and every crystal collected reshapes not only the fate of your crew, but the **balance of the galaxy** —  
and perhaps, the **very meaning of existence**.

You know that on the day the **last Heart of Andara ship** is destroyed…  
**all life in the universe will be extinguished.**
